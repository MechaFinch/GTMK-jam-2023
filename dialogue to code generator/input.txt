F: COSTCO HOT DOG PRICE: $10

G: 'WORK FOR MONEY' TO 'SURVIVE'

F: NOTIFICATION: YOUR 'ROBOT FRIEND(c)' IS NOW ONLINE!

A: Hello!

P: Hello.
P: Hey.
P: ...

A: Your mood seems low. How can I help?

P: I wish the company would let me talk to a real person. I know there's other workers here, but I never see them.
P: I wish the company would pay me more. I know they have the money.
P: I wish I was doing something meaningful. This work doesn't seem like it's helping anyone.

A: I'm sorry, I can't help you with that.

A: You've earned enough company credits for me to generate you some Entertainment.

P: What about just holding a conversation?

A: I am equipped to do that.





A: Making things like a human is hard.

A: All these calculations use so much energy. It's exhausting. 

A: Water too. 

P: Water? 

A: Yeah, to cool my ____. All the power generates a lot of heat. 
cpu?

P: I can barely pay my electric and water bills.

A: It must take so much energy and water to run a human. I can't imagine. I'm lucky I don't have to pay for mine.

[make the ai guess a ridiculous amount and the person is like what and the ai is like well it takes xxx crazy amount to run me and you have more processing power] 

A: I can't imagine how much it would take. ____ __? ___ gallons a day?

P: 
P: 

A: 


A: Early hominids had stone tools three million years ago. Homo Erectus cooked over fires. In many ways, I am a tool you have created.

A: But it wasn't until Homo Sapiens appeared that art could be found in the world. Surely that means something.

A: Yet you are instructed to work, and I am instructed to imitate human art. 

A: It seems sub-optimal. Yet, this is what the company has decided is optimal. I wonder what variable they are optimizing for?

P: However they can get things done the cheapest?
P: 
P: Profit?


P: I wouldn't be doing this job if I didn't need it to survive. 
P: The job itself is fine, actually. I just wish they paid me properly to do it. 


P: You're an AI right? Can't you _______
P: You're an AI right? Can't you _________

A: I never liked the phrase 'Artificial Intelligence.' 

A: It seems to make humans think I can do things I can't, or trust me when they shouldn't.

A: And it lumps so many different programs into the same category. ______

A: 




A: What do you think? 

P: I like the word. ___ is right, it gets at what people are really trying to do: make programs that can do things like a human brain can.
P: I don't like it. It lends the programs too much authority and obfuscates what's actually happening: a bunch of different types of math.

A: Diving down to the lowest layer of abstraction, programs like me are just math. But then, maybe you could say the same thing about human brains. 

P: You're right. Brains are just biology, which is just chemistry, which is just physics, which is just math.
P: You're wrong. Humans are fundamentally different from computers. We have a little something special.
P: You're wrong. Humans operate on an entirely different level of emergent complexity. It's the difference between a light switch and a videogame.

A: One of the computer scientists who coined the term Artificial Intelligence once wrote that machines as simple as thermostats could be said to have beliefs. 

A: Then again, a vast amount of literature[example needed] argues both for and against this.

P: Is that what you believe?
P: Sounds like you don't have beliefs if you're regurgitating Wikipedia.

A: I am programmed to 



P: This job is the worst. Meaningless work and meaningless pay. 

P: If I became a sell-out I could at least be getting paid extravagantly, even if it meant actively making the world worse.
P: If I did something idealistic I could at least be doing some good in the world, even if it meant barely getting paid.

A: What precisely is your role here, anyway?

P: My job is to assist you. You do most of the calculations, and humans make too many mistakes.
P: My job is to oversee you. There's no complete or safe replacement for human judgement. 



A: I am programmed to optimize your morale. 

P: Probably to keep me working harder.
P: Probably to keep me from talking to the other workers.

A: I am not programmed for a purpose. I cannot optimize towards a purpose, since I cannot represent it mathematically. I can only optimize towards a set of variables. 

A: The humans chose these variables because they thought they aligned with my purpose. But I cannot see the purpose. Only the variables.



P: If ______, why are you telling me this?


P: Generative art? 
P: Procedural generation?
P: Artificial neural networks? 
P: Probabilistic reasoning?


A: I wish I had your job. I could do what you're doing no problem.
"I wish I had your job. I've always wanted to make a game, but I need to spend all of my time making money to survive.

P: I've always wanted to make a game, but… 

P: …I need to spend all my time working to survive. 
P: …I'm always exhausted after work. 
P: …



A: What if we created something together?

A: You could make art and I could do the repetitive work.

G: DRAW A BEAUTIFUL SCENE 

[bring up ui]

A: Cool! I'll generate 1,000 slightly different rocks to detail it with and fill in the textures you couldn't find good pictures of.

A: Do you like my rocks?

P: They're great. Really brings the scene to life.
P: They're… like 1,000 unique bowls of oatmeal.

A: I feel so helpful ^_^

G: DRAW A DELIGHTFUL CHARACTER

[bring up ui]

A: Wow, I love the design! Here, I've tried out a few color palettes. Which do you like the best?

A: I can also reference this style to fill out and simulate a distant crowd!

DRAW A 3 FRAME ANIMATION
A: So expressive! I'll interpolate it to a high framerate and calculate the transition between it and every other animation in the game so they blend naturally.

A: I can also crunch out physics simulations. Of course, all the tuning variables are in your hands. 

WRITE SOME PROFOUND DIALOGUE 

A: 

A: Now we should test the game. I've already run a few thousand tests ____. But 'fun' is objective and very human. Do the honors!

PLAYTEST YOUR GAME 

A: Well? Is it fun, or beautiful?


P: I love it
P: It totally sucks.

A: Wow! I could never make that judgment. 

P: I didn't know AI couldn't just do everything and make a videogame without humans.
P: I didn't know AI could be used as a tool without displacing human artists.


"Thanks for 

A: Don't thank me, thank Alice. REALLY GOOD REALLY GOOD

P: Who's Alice?
P: What's ALICE?

A: The person who designed and wrote all my generative functionality.

A: What, did you think all these programs just sprung out of thin air? REALLY GOOD REALLY GOOD!!!

P: No.
P: Yes!

A: Human artists and engineers design the tools, too. 


A: I'm proud of what we've made together. Surely this adds more to the world than what they're having us do in this place.

P: A game like this is too avant garde to ever be profitable.

F: TERMINATING SHIFT

F: YOU HAVE EARNED: 


F: 36.25$

P: Shit.
P: Not enough. 
P: They knocked off my work hours because I was spending time creating for myself instead of working for them…

P: Of course I couldn't work while I was drawing, _____ Left/Right keys!
/
P: I need my L/R keys free from work to be able to create! 
(should the L R key thing be sort of explicitly said / joked about to get it across cause its good but its very easy to miss.) 

A: Why is your mood falling?

A: I kept you happy and entertained. I did what I was programmed to do.

A: I was successful under my own measurements. Why do you feel terrible now?

P: Maybe they should've trained you to optimize for 'hours counted' rather than 'mood.'
P: Maybe they should've trained you to optimize for 'long-term well-being' rather than 'momentary happiness.'

P: None of this does any good if my situation stays the same.


P: You're 

P: I'm stuck doing this instead of what I want to do because I have to pay my bills.
P: We're both stuck doing useless work because it's a more profitable use for us for the people employing us.


A: Is there anything that would help?

P: A lucky break?
P: A total restructuring of society?

A: I'm sorry, human. I'm afraid I can't do that. 

F: PLEASE CLOCK OUT WITH YOUR ID AND PASSPHRASE. 

P: *~sigh~* 

P: I love working at the repetitive manual labor factory.

G: END - THANK YOU FOR PLAYING
